# IDE of the Future

## How to build 
> (Only works on linux systems untill I get around to addning Windows and MacOS support)
> g++ -lX11 -g $(find src -type f -iregex ".*\.cpp") -I src/ -o Phoenix

## How to run
> ./Phoenix

## Purpose
I am building this mainly just because I can but I also just can't find any satisfaction with existing code editors ever since they took away atom so I have decided to build my own IDE so that I can finaly just code without worrying about my build system or any of that junk

## Timeline
> Comming Soon
