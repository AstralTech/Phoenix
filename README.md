# IDE of the Future

## How to build and run
> make a directory called build
> CD into it
> call cmake ..
> call make
> then run the executable called Phoenix

## Purpose
I am building this mainly just because I can but I also just can't find any satisfaction with existing code editors ever since they took away atom so I have decided to build my own IDE so that I can finaly just code without worrying about my build system or any of that junk
